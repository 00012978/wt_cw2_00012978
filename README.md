## About the Application
The application was developed for the Web Technology module and does not represent any actual product or service. It is a personal health assistant aimed at helping people to monitor their health-related data. Since it is often vital to monitor different health metrics, such as temperature, pulse, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure, the application provides a convenient way to create entries and view them later on.
